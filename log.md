# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: July 30, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I am a novice coder. I worked on the exercises on arrays and started Progate's course for Ruby on Rails.

**Thoughts:** I have been dragging on the Ruby Monstas for beginners course for a while now that the simplest excercises take me longer than what they should. I hope with this challenge I can "refresh" my mind and become focused so that I can advance. I don't want to get stuck with tutorials, going around in circles. It shouldn't take me longer than 4 days to finish the beginners course by Ruby Monstas if I stay committed to this challenge of minimum an hour coding a day. I'm looking foward to start their web development course soon. Progate is a new platform I started trying out today... It has a bit of a different teaching style that I still am not sure if I like/works for me. I'll see if I will stick to them as I go along.
