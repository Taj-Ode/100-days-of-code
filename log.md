# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: July 30, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I am a novice coder. I worked on the exercises on arrays and started Progate's course for Ruby on Rails.

**Thoughts:** I have been dragging on the Ruby Monstas for beginners course for a while now, that even the simpler excercises take me longer than what they used to when I first started off with Codecademy. I hope with this challenge I can "refresh" my mind and become focused so that I can advance. I don't want to get stuck with tutorials, going around in circles. I estimate that it shouldn't take me longer than 4 days to finish the remainder of the beginners course by Ruby Monstas if I stay committed to this challenge of minimum an hour coding a day. I'm looking foward to start their web development course soon. Progate is a new platform I started trying out today. It has a bit of a different teaching style that I am not sure if I like/works for me. I'll see if I will stick to the platform as I go along.

### Day 1: July 31, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I worked on the exercises on nested arrays and hashes with Ruby Monstas and started the Odin projects' course for Ruby on Rails.

**Thoughts:** I struggled with a few concepts regarding creating columns from multidimensional arrays. Learned new methods such as .ljust and .transpose. I will return to these same excercises tomorrow with fresh eyes and just read through the code again. I find that it helps me understand what is going on when I try read my code like it's just an instruction manual in english. Otherwise I might make a gist to see if someone will help me breakdown the code. Next I started the Ruby on Rails course from The Odin Project. I am only in the Introduction chapter and struggling alot with the installation parts. I think this says I should take time to read more about how the command prompt actually works and how to understand error codes from there. Nevertheless, I finally turned to The Odin Project's forum page and asked for help. Hopefully I can get some guidance in the right direction to move on tomorrow. Furthermore, I have been reading through their page and my instictual feeling is that The Odin Project is more suitable for me than Progate. It's the teaching style that I prefer. Progate's slides/text message canvas approach is a little distracting for me opposed to just reading text like you would in a good old text book, which is more like Odin's style.
