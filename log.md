# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: July 30, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I am a novice coder. I worked on the exercises on arrays and started Progate's course for Ruby on Rails.

**Thoughts:** I have been dragging on the Ruby Monstas for beginners course for a while now, that even the simpler excercises take me longer than what they used to when I first started off with Codecademy. I hope with this challenge I can "refresh" my mind and become focused so that I can advance. I don't want to get stuck with tutorials, going around in circles. I estimate that it shouldn't take me longer than 4 days to finish the remainder of the beginners course by Ruby Monstas if I stay committed to this challenge of minimum an hour coding a day. I'm looking foward to start their web development course soon. Progate is a new platform I started trying out today. It has a bit of a different teaching style that I am not sure if I like/works for me. I'll see if I will stick to the platform as I go along.

### Day 2: July 31, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I worked on the exercises on nested arrays and hashes with Ruby Monstas and started the Odin projects' course for Ruby on Rails.

**Thoughts:** I struggled with a few concepts regarding creating columns from multidimensional arrays. Learned new methods such as .ljust and .transpose. I will return to these same excercises tomorrow with fresh eyes and just read through the code again. I find that it helps me understand what is going on when I try read my code like it's just an instruction manual in english. Otherwise I might make a gist to see if someone will help me breakdown the code. Next I started the Ruby on Rails course from The Odin Project. I am only in the Introduction chapter and struggling alot with the installation parts. I think this says I should take time to read more about how the command prompt actually works and how to understand error codes from there. Nevertheless, I finally turned to The Odin Project's discord chat and asked for help. Hopefully I can get some guidance in the right direction to move on tomorrow. Furthermore, I have been reading through their page and my instictual feeling is that The Odin Project is more suitable for me than Progate. It's the teaching style that I prefer. Progate's slides/text message canvas approach is a little distracting for me opposed to just reading text like you would in a good old text book, which is more like Odin's style.

### Day 3: August 1, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I spent time on learning about how the internet works with The Odin Project, writing classes with Ruby Monstas and learning about TDD with Exercism.

**Thoughts:** Yesterday when I was struggling with the installation of Heroku and decided to ask for help on Odin's discord chat, I was told I should begin with their Web Development 101 course. This had completely flown past me. Makes me again think of how difficult it is to learn in an "organized and efficient way" when self teaching. There are a whole bunch of resources out there but it can be daunting to figure out in which order to get through them. Good thing Odin has a Ruby on Rails path that is very clearly laid out! This means though that I will first need to begin at the root of the tree instead of halfway up the stem, duh. I have really enjoyed learning about how the internet works today and Odin's page is proving to be a real gem honestly. They refer to so many excellent external sources along with their own great content. I am looking forward to continuing learning with the help of their platform. Furthermore I worked on writing classes with Ruby Monstas. The last of the three excercises I did today I haven't completed and will be returning to tomorrow; it is quite extensive and honestly feels a little intimidating but exciting at the same time to try solve. I have decided that after I finish all the excercises they have in their beginners course I will pause there with Ruby Monstas. The next course is about building a web application but I want to get more familiar with the basics therefore I have enrolled in Exercism's Ruby course. What I find terribly fun about their platform is how they introduce TDD from the get go so I look forward to learn more about that in practice as I proceed; I've only previously read about it or seen others practice it.

At the moment I feel like I might be overwhelming myself here so to clarify the purpose of the things I am doing to myself:
  - **The Odin Project:** Is to help me better understand web development using Ruby and Ruby on Rails.
  - **Ruby Monstas:** Has been to help me practice Ruby fundamentals.
  - **Exercism:** Is to help me solidify Ruby fundamentals and help me become more comfortable with using the command prompt and my editor (in other words become more comfortable with using my computer for the purpose of coding).

### Day 4: August 2, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I spent time learning about the differences between a web page, a web server, and a search engine.

**Thoughts:** This is a delayed post as I have been quite overwhelmed the past few days. On Sunday I spent the evening learning about the differences mentioned about and felt a drop of "aaaaaaah" euphoria when I went onto safari on my phone and got the error message "Safari cannot open this page because the server is not responding" because I understood exactly what I was being told and how it worked. This day was short however something was learned!

### Day 5: August 3, 2020

**Today's Progress**: SKIPPED

**Thoughts:** Unfortunately this day I didn't code. I finished work at 18:30 and had a comedy gig at 20:30 that I spent time "prepping" for after work. I say prepping because I was whining a lot while doing it because I actually didn't feel like going on stage that particular day but no way I could cancel last minute. Ended doing a lot of improv on jokes I roughly made up during the short prep time.

### Day 6: August 4, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Finished reading about the mechanism of the internet with The Odin Project and started one Excercise with Exercism.

**Thoughts:** I particularly spent time understanding the connections between client units and servers as well as how the DNS works. It was very interesting to read about. DNS was a bit harder to digest so tomorrow I will read about it once more and try to explain it shortly to my roommate on thursday. The excercise I started today on Exercism has been fun so far, a little challenging to solve but I'm sure tomorrow I will be able to crack it. It has me practicing writing classes, methods and instantiating, all of which I need to practice a lot! Honestly, it's so much fun working with the TDD approach. Everytime I receive a new type of error, I know I am one step closer to solving the problem. I feel a jilt of excitement to continue and continue. This weekend I plan to touch base on regex and will take some time to read on TDD as well.
